# YanYu Intelligence Cloud³ (YYC³) - Operation Manual

**Version:** 7.3  
**Status:** PROD  
**Date:** 2026-02-04

## 1. System Overview

**YanYu Intelligence Cloud³ (YYC³)** is a next-generation 3D AI assistant designed with a "Zero UI" philosophy. It abandons traditional navigation bars in favor of spatial gestures and holographic interactions. The core of the system is the **Responsive Cube**, a sentient visual interface that reacts to voice, touch, and data streams.

## 2. Gesture Navigation System (Spatial Controls)

The interface relies entirely on gestures performed on the main stage.

### Basic Interactions
| Gesture | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tap (Cube)** | Toggle Listening | Starts or stops the voice recognition system. |
| **Double Tap** | Orbital Menu | Opens the quick-access circular menu for core tools. |
| **Long Press** | Voice Mode | Hold anywhere on the screen (except interactive elements) to command via voice. |

### Directional Swipes (Threshold: 60px)
| Direction | Module | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Swipe Up** | **Terminal Nexus** | Opens the advanced command center (Text/Voice/File). |
| **Swipe Down** | **Memory Stream** | View chat history and session logs. |
| **Swipe Left** | **Intelligent Hub** | Access the central node map (Task Pod, Security, etc.). |
| **Swipe Right** | **Config Panel** | Open LLM settings, model selection, and parameter tuning. |

### Diagonal Swipes (Advanced)
| Direction | Protocol | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Top-Left ↘** | **Task Pod** | Opens the task management matrix. |
| **Top-Right ↙** | **Debate Matrix** | Initiates an AI-driven debate on the current topic. |
| **Bottom-Left ↗** | **Reset** | Reboots the session context (clears short-term memory). |
| **Bottom-Right ↖** | **Theme Toggle** | Switches between Cyan (Logical) and Red (Tactical) modes. |

## 3. Terminal Nexus (New Feature)

*Accessed via **Swipe Up**.*

The **Terminal Nexus** is the primary interface for complex data entry when voice interaction is insufficient.

### Features
1.  **Command Line Interface**: A high-fidelity text input field for precise prompts.
2.  **Audio Matrix (Voice)**:
    *   Tap the **Microphone Icon** to toggle voice input directly within the terminal.
    *   Real-time transcriptions appear in the input field.
3.  **Data Ingestion (File Upload)**:
    *   Tap the **Paperclip Icon** to open the file picker.
    *   Supported Formats: Images (JPG, PNG).
    *   **Preview**: Uploaded images appear as holographic thumbnails before sending.
    *   **Drag & Drop**: You can also drag files directly onto the main screen to trigger "Ingestion Mode".

## 4. Intelligent Center & Models

*Accessed via **Swipe Left**.*

This is the system's "Brain Map". Nodes float in 3D space.
*   **Core Engine**: Central processing unit.
*   **Task Pod**: Automated task breakdown and tracking.
*   **Neural Net**: Connection status monitoring.

### Global Model Network (Config Panel)
*Accessed via **Swipe Right**.*
*   **Providers**: Support for OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), Google Gemini, and **Zhipu AI (GLM-4)**, **Moonshot (Kimi)**, **01.AI (Yi)**.
*   **Auto-Optimization**: The system detects the selected model architecture and provides real-time optimization hints (e.g., "Use XML for Claude").
*   **Tuning**: Sliders for Temperature (Creativity) and Top-P (Focus).

---

## 5. Visualizer & Feedback

*   **Listening State**: The Cube transforms into a reactive waveform.
*   **Processing**: The Cube spins rapidly with data particle emissions.
*   **Idle**: The Cube "breathes" slowly in the center.
*   **Theme Engine**:
    *   **Cyan Mode**: Optimized for coding, logic, and general assistance.
    *   **Red Mode**: Optimized for alerts, critical analysis, and night ops.
